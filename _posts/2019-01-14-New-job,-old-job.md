So I arrived at Zürich. Here, I've started a job as a Postdoc (one thing you can do after your time as a PhD student) at the ETH Zürich. So far, I'm living out of my suitcase, but despite not having a flat yet, I have a desk at the office and a computer to work with.  

Geothermics is still the main topic of my work (that's why the title is what it is), but now really applied. I'm part of a pilot study of the Swiss government to assess the potential of its different Cantons for geothermal energy production. Quite exciting, as this is not only of academic interest, but political and economic interest. Switzerland wants to move to renewable energy sources in the next years / decades, wants to replace its nuclear power production.

Geothermal energy production can be one complementary part of an energy mix to step in for previous energy sources. Part of my project will be to develop an integrative and adaptive workflow from data-assessment to heat-transport simulations. This resulting workflow should be easily adapted to other Cantons in future projects. I guess I will learn a lot about databases and automatic workflows in the next few months / years, and I plan on documenting and posting my learning progress here....
