In August 2017, the solar institute of the FH Aachen/JÃ¼lich opened its gates for the annual multi-week summerschool covering almost all aspects of the topic _renewable energy_. The interdisciplinary audience learned about production and distribution of renewable energy (solar, wind, water, geothermal), i.e. about aspects covering the whole _workflow_ until the power outlet.  
I was asked to give a lecture about geothermal energy and its share in the current energy mix. The lecture covered topics from theory (the "energy houshould of the earth"), characterization of geothermal reservoirs (a bit geosciences), and how geothermal can be used as a storing technique for surplus energy provided by wind or solar (in a sense of a complementary energy mix). The pdf of the lecture (**in german**) can be found [here](link to pdf).
