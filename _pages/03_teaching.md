### Teaching philosophy  

When it comes to teaching, lecturers are vastly different in my experience. I've had the full spectrum, dull lecturers, working through their script with their main interest being to pass the 90 minutes of student contact, and inspiring lecturers who get you personally interested in the topic they are teaching.  
I try to be one of the latter. That's why I seek to develop new ways of transfering the lecture-content, and try to come up with very descriptive and graphic examples. This turns out to be difficult very often as detailed knowledge is required to be able to break a complex topic down into _simple_ processes. One man who excells at teaching, and being one big Idol of mine, was [Richard Feynman](wiki-feynman).  
Further I try to incorporate digital learning methods in my teaching, namely in form of [Jupyter notebooks](https://www.project-jupyter.org). I use them in the exercise course _Geothermics_ I teach at the [RWTH Aachen University](www.rwth-aachen.de).
