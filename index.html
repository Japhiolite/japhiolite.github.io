<h2>Welcome!</h2>

Welcome on Japhiolite.io. This site contains information about my research-work. Under teaching, you will find material and documentation of the exercise-course <i>Geothermics</i> which I teach at the RWTH Aachen University. 
And finally, if I might have to tell something of interest, you will find blog posts about things related to geothermal energy and/or exciting developments around jupyter notebooks (as those are my main professional interests).
